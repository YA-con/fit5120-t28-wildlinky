          <p>Recycling and reducing waste are great â€” but theyâ€™re not enough to protect forests.</p>
          <p>Policies are the rules that shape what governments, councils, and industries can do. They control how much forest gets cleared, how species are protected, and whoâ€™s held accountable.</p>
          <p>When you understand these policies, you can use them to speak up â€” and your voice becomes harder to ignore.</p>
          <p>One strong email, backed by the right policy snippet, can protect more habitat than months of everyday eco-habits.</p>
